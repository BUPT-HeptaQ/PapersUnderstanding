cv2.drawMatches(imageA, kpsA, imageB, kpsB, matches[:10], None, flags=2) 	# connect the key points of two image

Parameter description: imageA and imageB represent pictures, kpsA and kpsB represent key points, 
matches indicate matching index values obtained by cv2.BFMatcher, and distances, flags indicate SIFT feature points with several images.

code description:
Step 1: Use sift.detectAndComputer to find key points and sift feature vectors
Step 2: build BFMatcher () brute force matcher, bf.match matches sift feature vector, using Euclidean distance
Step 3: Sort the matches by distance according to the matching result matches.distance
Step 4: Perform drawing operations and use cv2.drawMatches for drawing operations
